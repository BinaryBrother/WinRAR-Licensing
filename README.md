This leverages a long-time vulnerability in the way that WinRAR generates its licenses.

I used the vuleranbility to generate a valid license for WinRAR. You can find more licenses, <a href="https://github.com/BinaryBrother/WinRAR-Licensing/tree/main/Other_Keys">here</a>.

You probably want to check out our <a href="https://github.com/BinaryBrother/WinRAR-Licensing/releases">Releases</a>.

Last tested WinRAR version: <b>v7.12</b> (Current as of writing)
