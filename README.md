<h1>True Apps</h1>
<p>This licensing project leverages a long-time <a href="https://github.com/bitcookies/winrar-keygen">vulnerability</a> in the way that WinRAR generates its licenses.</p>
<p>This project has a clean approach to licensing the WinRAR Client.</p>
<p>First, it leverages the above mentioned vulnerability (Open-Source) to generate an authentic license for WinRAR.<br /> Second, it takes that license and applies it for you.</p>
<p>What makes this project stand out, is that it generates a valid license <strong><em>on-the-fly</em></strong> and doesn't rely on crude modifications of the WinRAR client, which cause WinRAR to lose its licensing status everytime WinRAR updates.</p>
<p>Once the WinRAR client has been modified, it's no longer Digitally Signed by RAR-Labs and can't be totally trusted. Worse, other developers take extra steps to make sure that other License Generators are obfuscated and difficult to reverse-engineer.</p>
<p><strong>We want to run Clean and Current. You download WinRAR straight from the source, always.</strong></p>
<p>With the other <em>"cracks"</em>, the developer uses a vulnerability to generate a single license and then distributes that package with a static license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Instructions</h1>
